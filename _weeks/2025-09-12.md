### Background Music: From Furniture Music to Lofi Girl 

You know the music, the kind of smooth and subtle, instrumental tunes that play in the cool cafe near you. Background music isn't a new idea, but YouTube and music streaming services have given us control of it. Instead of just hearing it in public places, we can now choose what we want to listen to.

The original concept dates back to 1917, when Erik Satie developed what he called *musique d‚Äôameublement* or [furniture music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture_music). Furniture or *furnishing* music was  intended to be performed by live musicians as a sort of backing track to social gatherings and events. [They still hold up.](https://youtu.be/KjSBSxWMnNo?si=u24ep4Wh2UaXE8QS&t=504) The five original short tracks were rarely performed and remained unpublished until the 1960s, well after Satie's death in 1925.

In 1940, the BBC had the novel idea that playing loops of popular music to factory workers would help them be more productive. Thus ["Music While You Work"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_While_You_Work) was born, and blasted a succession of tunes to idle hands for 27 years, bookended by the signature tune ["Calling All Workers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP1Ch1FVGhs), composed by [Eric Coates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Coates).

"Music While You Work" was performed by a live band and broadcast over the radio through large speakers to the factory workers. While live performances are wonderful, the 1950s post-war boom meant more factories, more people and more situations for background music. This is the age of [Muzak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzak). Muzak of course, being a [genericised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_trademark) trademark for [elevator music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_music).

Imagine an elevator scene in a movie. Two characters are awkwardly waiting for the elevator to reach to their floor, while standing side by side in quiet discomfort. The song that's probably playing in your head is ["The Girl From Ipanema"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urXvUmhd05k) by Brazilian composer and inventor of the Bossa-Nova genre [Ant√¥nio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant√¥nio_Carlos_Jobim).

Beyond elevators, the need for popular, reliable, and repeatable ambient music was answered by the [Seeburg 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeburg_1000) phonograph in 1959. This small blue box was capable of playing both sides of twenty-five 9" records, totaling 1,000 unique songs. The expansive collection of records had different libraries you could choose from including *Lifestyle*, *Industrial*, *Mellow Mood*, *Penthouse* and even a special *Christmas* library, all delivered by rolling subscription to your local shopping centre, Dr's surgery or restaurant for customer's auditory enjoyment.

 While now thoroughly outdated, there are examples of these machines [still working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kCHx3_vu9M) and you can [listen to some of the wonderful music online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvJjVxbJTZA).

 In 1979, musician [Brian Eno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_1:_Music_for_Airports), disappointed with the uninspired atmosphere of Cologne Bonn Airport, composed [Ambient 1: Music for Airports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNwYtllyt3Q&list=RDvNwYtllyt3Q&start_radio=1) and essentially invented the ambient music genre. Eno wanted his work to be *"as ignorable as interesting"* and allow for quiet thought, contemplation and calm, rather than structured productivity encouraged by Muzak.


Lo-Fi (low fidelity) is perhaps the most recent incarnation of popular background music. While Lo-Fi itself dates back to the late 1980s as a DIY, homemade and nostalgic counterpoint to increasingly highly produced radio music, it's most recognisable icon is of course, the original long-running [Lofi Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk) hip-hop Lo-Fi YouTube stream started in 2017 by French producer Dimitri Somoguy.

Lofi Girl's name is "Jade" (like her jumper) and she lives in [Lyon, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Croix-Rousse) with her orange tabby cat. Originally modelled on Shizuku Tsukishima from the [Studio Ghibli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli) film [Whisper of the Heart (1995)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisper_of_the_Heart), her new design was created in the style of [Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki) by Colombian-French artist [Juan Pablo Machado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pablo_Machado) after one too many copyright strikes. In 2023, the channel launched Lofi Boy, a [synthwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthwave) stream featuring the titular boy and his dog. The blue lit room in which he is studying is visible in background of the Lofi Girl streams on the other side of Lyon.

The Lofi Girl video format and style is often emulated, and to finish this week's links, here are a few examples, ranging from wonderful to unhinged.
