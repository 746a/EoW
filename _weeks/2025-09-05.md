# Friday 5th September 2025

## The Origin of the Idea

Today I shared a video with a friend, it was a 2009 TED Talk from Adam Savage about curiosity, Dodo skeletons and The Maltese Falcon. Since 2009 I have adopted Adam Savage's Creative Projects idea discussed in the video for curation reference material. It's something I've been doing now for 16 years, and I still find value in not only the process, but the archived product. It keeps my creativity fed and my itch to organise satiated. After sharing the video my friend replied:

*"I've also now decided that watching something like that on a friday morning with a cup of coffee before calls start is pure zen so can we please start a friday inspo club when you're back as my sanity thanks you for that"*

That sounded like a fun idea, so I built this.

Welcome to **EoWW**, a curated end of weekly selection of curious things to reverse work week woe.

### The Creative Projects Folder from Adam Savage
[Adam Savage: My Obsession With Objects and the Stories They Tell - TED Talk 2009](https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_savage_my_obsession_with_objects_and_the_stories_they_tell) Adam discusses his 'Creative Projects' folder at around 1:40 as a way to distil images from the internet into discrete file directories of inspiration. I've been doing this for 16 years and still find it fascinating. Sometimes I will unearth stuff I saved a decade ago and think *"Who liked this? Why did I think this was worth storing?"* and other times I come across something I love so thoroughly that I want to thank the person who saved it for me, then I remember, that's me. Thanks me.

I wonder if Adam is still actively adding to his folder, and I wonder if it has developed or evolved at all over time? Perhaps I've missed an update from [Tested](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA), his excellent home on the visual internet. I myself have spent some time developing a complex system of scripts to tag, manage and coordinate the thousands of images in my archive in a misguided attempt to do away with folders (the hubris!) but have found myself often stymied by the sheer weight of so many images. As with many things like this, developing the process is part of the fun.

### The Spaces Between Words
Did you know that spaces between words, like these, didn't appear in European written languages until around 1,200 years ago?
<br><br>```THE·ROMANS·VSED·INTERPVNCTS·BETWEEN·WORDS```<br><br>
These are still often seen in [architectural inscriptions](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pantheon_Rom_1_cropped.jpg#/media/File:Pantheon_Rom_1_cropped.jpg). You can type an interpunct on Mac using ```Option+Shift+9```. The Romans then adopted the Greek style of [Scriptio Continua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptio_continua), where all letters flow into one another in a continuous stream. It was up to the reader to determine where and what em*pha*sis to put on the words. We'll not even talk about [Boustrophedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon) but it's mad and fascinating.<br><br>As reading shifted from performance to [silent self study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_reading), conventional spacing between words became more important and emerged in Irish and Anglo-Saxon Bibles during the seventh and eight centuries.<br><br>Ironically, Scriptio Continua has returned with the internet, and you've all used it. There are no spaces in [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) and Roman interpunct case became [Kebab Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case).
