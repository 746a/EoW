### Slowing Down YouTube 

I've watched YouTube for an awfully long time, and I have a love-hate relationship with it. It's a true melting pot of fascinating information, personalities and ideas. You can hop from Korean food videos to tool box reviews, watch someone build a patio then quote every word from a collection of memes from the ancient times of [Vine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)). I love the breadth and depth of content, the potential for weird and unique connection with interesting humans. 

I do not like the commidification and commercialisation of the platform. Beyond the increasingly pervasive advertising, people stop making videos about weird things they think or see or do, and start constructing A/B perfected video products (interspersed with ad breaks and sponsored segments) to be churned out to customers for maximum engagement.

It used to be an [agora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora) full of philosophers and weirdos and hawkers and normal people just doing stuff, now it's like the [TV shop window full of stacked televisions](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StorefrontTelevisionDisplay), except all the channels are tuned to someone shouting, [the volumes dials are stuck at a distorted maximum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1828lQRbK5o) and everyone wants your money.

So, what's the solution? What's the antithesis to loud, brash and in your face videos that demand your attention and money with peer tested thumbnails and *10% codes just for you but act now before it's too late?*

Slower videos, many of them in languages other than English, that focus on deliberate, engaging and authentic perspectives.

There is a niche of YouTube, perhaps a distant cousin of auditory sensory meridian response ([ASMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR)) videos, that is typified by non-English YouTube videos about a particular topic. The creators often don't speak (English or otherwise) in their videos, but go to great lengths to subtitle in multiple languages what's happening onscreen. This is done using YouTube's own subtitling system, but others will actually bake their own subtitles onscreen in the video as well. Rather than the traditional usage of [subtitles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitles) for conveying what is audibly said in the video, these subtitles textually describe what's happening visually, to add context and understanding. In this way, they function far more like [intertitles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertitle) and harken back to an older age of [silent cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film).

Because you are watching **and** reading, I find that these videos feel more contemplative and engaging. The origins of this sub-genre are murky and unclear, but certainly one of the oldest is [Primitive Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P73REgj-3UE&t=2s). One Australian man in the outback, building shelters and tools wearing only shorts and using only what he finds around him. The videos are long, slow and have deliberately minimal editing. A series of cuts to move the story forward. Little to no onscreen speaking, graphics or calls to action.

It's weird, it's joyous, it's everything I thought YouTube had left behind with the advent of ***Last one to fall asleep gets tasered and then wins this Car*** challenges and ***I ate everything at [Buccee's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buc-ee's) and you'll never guess who this week's sponsor is*** corporate content.

I know that YouTube is a commerical platform, and I know people spend time and energy making great videos for it. I myself love lots of YouTube channels that don't fall into this category, but sometimes, it is lovely to just immerse yourself in the whimsy of someone else's hyperfocused special interest.

So, here are a range of options, in no order, of whimsical and fascinating slow YouTube videos.

- If you are looking for ASMR videos, you should start and end with [MUTHUR 6000 Mainframe Ambience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APpkBhWeoFk).

- If you want to sample lots of Asian street food, without getting on an aeroplane, it's [Yummyboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK3vcaJ47DY).

- If you want to open and run a small French book shop and cafe, check out [Emilie's Literary Corner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyFGIDVaVck).

- If you want to build a castle in the Catskill mountains from shipping containers, it can only be [Andrew Camerata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGlJDxN2zlE).

- If you want to wake up at 5am and make delicious, healthy Korean food, you should watch [꿀주부 Honeyjubu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voplO4--fko).

- If you want to follow along on jobs with a metalworker in Norway, then [Crafted Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-FTILWm_Jo) is your first choice.

- If you fancy making pizzas at Domino's without getting off the sofa, then [Dominic Rest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA1nWaUpWzQ) is the answer.

- If you prefer your food a little more upscale, then working a busy shift in a London restaurant with [Fallow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iOLbfYmgdQ) is probably more your speed.

- And, finally, if you have decided you've had enough, and you just want to go dig a well in the 1800's Wild West, then [Western Pioneer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIKmkJDV-Y0) has you(r wagons) covered.
