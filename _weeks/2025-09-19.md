### Bagels and Bananas in Belfast

I'm on paternity leave, and one of the best parts of that (aside from cuddling an adorable newborn) is getting to try all the food places I never seem to have time for during the work week. We decided to visit [Bodega Bagels](https://www.bodegabagels.co.uk/) for breakfast and their toddler friendly play session on a Thursday morning. I've eaten at their City Centre location on Royal Avenue, but this was their original spot inside [Banana Block](https://bananablock.org/) (the Portview Trade Centre) in East Belfast. (It's awesome.)

While scoffing a Jalapeño and Cheese bagel with Jalapeño [schmear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmear) (delicious) I got to reading sign boards on the walls of the old spinning mill, as I am wont to do.

It turns out, than the Banana Block is named for one [William Richardson of East Belfast](https://www.visiteastside.com/kin-edar-local-history-and-one-place-studies), who decided that East Belfast was the perfect spot to [grow some bananas](https://bananablock.org/about/)! There are even some large banana plants inside to tower over you whilst you eat your delicious breakfast. William was head gardener for [Sir Otto Jaffe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Jaffe), two time Lord Mayor of Belfast, Jewish community leader, entrepreneur and philanthropist. Otto erected the [Jaffe Fountain](https://memorialdrinkingfountains.wordpress.com/tag/daniel-joseph-jaffe/) in Victoria Square to commemorate his father Daniel Joseph Jaffe.

The Northern Irish climate is not traditionally conducive to tropical plant, berry or fruit cultivation, but interestingly, William's East Belfast bananas are not alone.

Belfast's [Botanic Gardens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botanic_Gardens_(Belfast)) hosts both the [Tropical Ravine](https://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/things-to-do/tropical-ravine/visiting-the-tropical-ravine#1159-2) and the [Palm House](https://discovernorthernireland.com/things-to-do/belfast-botanic-gardens-and-palm-house-p674821).

Designed by [Charles Lanyon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lanyon) and built by [Richard Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Turner_(iron-founder)) of Dublin, the Palm House is probably one of the most iconic images of Belfast, alongside [the cranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_and_Goliath_(cranes)). Lanyon created a number of other Northern Irish landmarks, including the main Lanyon Building of [Queen's University of Belfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_University_of_Belfast) in 1849. The design was based on [Magdalen College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalen_College) in Oxford. Turner was a famous iron-founder and instrumental in early glasshouse construction. He is also responsible for the [Temperate House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_House) and [Palm house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_house) at [Kew Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kew_Gardens) in London.

One of the oldest specimens in the Palm House is a 400 year old Australian succulent [Xanthorrhoea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthorrhoea), which is basically as old as [modern Belfast itself.](https://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/galleries/a-town-is-born-four-hundred-years-ago-belfast-officially-became-a-town-and-so-began-an-unlikely-success-story/29223858.html)

While cold and somewhat non-tropical conditions are not necessarily a non-starter for tropical plant cultivation, ripe and edible bananas are typically not cultivated at scale on the Newtownards Road. Perhaps Low-Tech magazine's article on [Solar Fruit Trenchs](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/04/fruit-trenches-cultivating-subtropical-plants-in-freezing-temperatures/
) could yield horticultural progress?

Assuming we work out the growing pains, we could use our fresh crop of Belfast bananas for all sorts of projects such as [estimating radiation doses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_equivalent_dose), [creating conceptual art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian_(artwork)), [making paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_paper), [baking some banana bread](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/bananabread_85720) or perhaps executing a slapstick slipping gag ([assuming you work out the proper frictional coefficient under a banana skin](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/trol/7/3/7_147/_pdf)). If that all fails, we can always get some [isoamyl acetate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoamyl_acetate) and pretend.
